3D-Maze-Simulation-and-Rendering
================================

A project for "Computer Graphics" on 6th Semester (B.E.),2012. 

*No Graphics Library used for drawing, shading and transformation of models ( as instructed by the college. )

<h2>Description</h2>
<br/>
“3D” maze is an attempt to model a 3D maze. It has its own modeling interface that can be used to design different type of patterns of maze.<p>
We started this project with a simple idea in mind, we wanted to be able to model a real world environment such as Building, Roads etc. and
then later use it in various fields like games(3D maze or environment) and even for 3D maps (displaying buildings etc.). The first step was to design a "Renderer" and then a simulator.
<p>
Our Simulator provides the input to the Renderer and the Renderer displays the 3D model.
